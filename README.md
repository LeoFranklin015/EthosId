# 🌍 Ethos ID

> Country-verified ENS subnames + verifiable credentials  
> Example: `leo.india.eth`

**Ethos ID** is an identity infrastructure that issues **country-verified ENS subnames** backed by **W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**.  
These credentials are embedded into ENS records and can be verified across any chain — enabling trustable, portable, and resilient on-chain identity.

## ✨ Why Ethos ID?

- **Trustable by design** – subnames issued only after proof of nationality.  
- **Cross-chain portability** – ENS + VC accessible on any EVM chain.  
- **Resilient identity** – even if ENS expires or wallets rotate, credentials can still be recovered using Self nullifiers.  
- **Verifiable records** – unlike arbitrary ENS text records, Ethos ID embeds cryptographic proofs.
